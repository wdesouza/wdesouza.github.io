I am PhD in Sciences working with bioinformatics, high-throughput sequencing data analysis and systems development for high-performance computing environments.

I currently held a Technical Training scholarship at Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, Department of Translational Medicine, School of Medical Sciences at the University of Campinas (Brazil), located at Laboratory of Biostatistics and Computacional Biology (http://bcblab.org/). I also collaborate with the Brazilian Initiative on Precision Medicine (https://bipmed.org/).
